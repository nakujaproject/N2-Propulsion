# N2-Propulsion

This is project repo for the propulsion team containing all our design and simulations for the N-2 development

## General info

This project is where our design files for the nakuja N2 Propulsion are held. Different softwares are used for the purpose of development, such as;

* OpenMotor - Fuel Simulations
* Fusion 360 - CAD Designs & PCB Design
* Casing.xls - Excel spreadsheet for casing design parameters
* Ansys Fluent - Computational Fluid Dynamics
